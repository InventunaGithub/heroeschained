  Title: Clearing the Tavern
  TitleLong: The Tavern is Full of Rats
  Description: This guild has been intact for one hundred years. Or was it two hundred?
    I don't remember, it was long ago.\n\nIf you really want to turn that tavern
    back into its good old days, you have to clean it from the reats first! No serious
    hero will stand there. I mean, as it is now...
